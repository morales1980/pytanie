                On the first part of the journey I was looking at all the life<br>
                There were plants and birds and rocks and things<br>
                There was sand and hills and rings<br>
                The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz<br>
                And the sky with no clouds<br>
                The heat was hot and the ground was dry<br>
                But the air was full of sound<br>
              </p>
              <p class="text-left">
                I've been through the desert on a horse with no name<br>
                It felt good to be out of the rain<br>
                In the desert you can remember your name<br>
                'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain<br>
                La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la<br>
                La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la<br>
              </p>
              <p class="text-left">
                After two days in the desert sun my skin began to turn red<br>
                After three days in the desert fun I was looking at a river bed<br>
                And the story it told of a river that flowed<br>
                Made me sad to think it was dead<br>
